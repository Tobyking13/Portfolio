  ## Description 

  I created a portfolio website using React and installed additional packages such as Bootstrap, Fontawesome, gh-pages, styled components, react router & babel to achieve my desired functionality. The development process was relatively straightforward. Using react router, I constructed each page and added components within them. To dynamically change the header title on each page, I used the useLocation hook to retrieve the URL information and a switch statement to format it accordingly. I encountered some issues with React's component hierarchy, but I was able to resolve them. Finally, I deployed the project to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages package, which facilitates the deployment of React applications to GitHub Pages.
